3. Builds the project
4. Deploys to their global CDN
5. Provides live URL

**Estimated Time:** 2-5 minutes

## 🎮 Share Your Game

Once deployed, you can share:
- **Direct Link**: Share the Vercel URL with anyone
- **GitHub Link**: https://github.com/pavansurya8059-spec/Chess

## 🔄 Auto-Updates

Every time you push updates to GitHub:
1. Vercel automatically detects the changes
2. Rebuilds and redeploys automatically

## 🛠️ Project Structure (Already Correct)

Your project has everything needed:
```
Chess/

├── game.js             ✅ Game logic
├── styles.css          ✅ Styling

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Repository not found"
- Check spelling: `pavansurya8059-spec/Chess`
- Make sure your GitHub repo is public or you're logged in

### Deployment takes too long
- Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
- Verify `package.json` is correct
- `node_modules` should be in `.gitignore`

### Site shows "404"
- Vercel is serving the wrong file
- Make sure `index.html` is in root directory
- Check your repository structure

### Changes not showing live
- Wait 2-5 minutes for auto-rebuild
- Check "Deployments" tab in Vercel
- Refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R for hard refresh)
